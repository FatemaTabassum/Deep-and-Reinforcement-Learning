We have run the program given in the 'Code' folder and stored the output in the 'AlphaFold_output' folder. So anyone can see the results directly from that folder. 

If anyone wish to run the program by oneself, then:
- Download the data from http://bit.ly/alphafold-casp13-data 
- Download the weights from http://bit.ly/alphafold-casp13-weights
- Copy the run_eval.sh script and run that from the deepmind-research folder. The run_eval.sh script is up to date.
